Game Summary
Core Concept

    Space-Themed Deck-Building Game: Players acquire cards from a shared market, generate resources, and play cards to achieve synergy. The game ends when a shared pool of points is depleted.

Mechanics

    Players must discard cards to play others, introducing trade-offs between hand utility and resource generation.
    Factions: Each player has a unique faction with tailored abilities and starting cards.
    Keywords: Introduced gameplay-enhancing keywords like Recycle, Evolve, Deploy, and Ethereal.
    Triggered Effects: Cards can now trigger effects on draw or discard, adding new strategic depth.
    Disruptive Cards: Introduced mechanics for disrupting opponent strategies or catching up when behind.

Market Cards

    Currently, 25 unique market cards, including core resource-generating cards, keyword-enhanced cards, draw/discard-triggered cards, and disruptive catch-up cards.

Pending Ideas

    Future expansion: Event Deck for global effects at the start of each round.
